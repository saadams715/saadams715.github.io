        <h1>Get to know Samantha Adams</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Physics and German. I'm apart of the International Engineering Program at URI and will be going abroad during my fourth year. There I will spend a semester taking classes at a German University and another semster partaking in an internship. During my freetime I enjoy Netflix. Recently I have been reliving my childhood by watching Avatar: The Last Airbender. If you are looking for something to watch I definitely recommend the series. I also enjoy spending my time with my two dogs. I have a black German Shepaerd named Lucifer and a chocolate Labador, Charlie. </p>
